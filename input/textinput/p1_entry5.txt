I am going home in 5 days. My treatment has seen ups and downs. SOmetimes the doctor did not pretend as good. He was irritated at times with my behavior and the nurses also were fed up of me. But it was not my mistake always. I had catheter inside and going to the wash room was difficult for me. So should the nurses get angry at me for that? BUt I am recovering and that matters. I have stopped listening to voices. Bipolar disorder seems at control. This is indeed great sign but I still feel nervous at times. Should I tell the doctor about this. He will tell me to stay for some more time but I want to go home early. BUt then I won't be 100 cent well. This is eating me but tomorrow I will tell Susan. She always has a solution for something. Everyone has bad and good times. How will I pay the rent after this hospital expense? MAry will have to go back to teaching again, and it shall take me fewmonths to recoer before I can join work. Lots of questions, there will be a solution for something. God I need a solution
