I am so bored.   I have been stuck in this room for at least three hours.  I finished my Percy Jackson book (one of my favorites from home) and I tried doing Sudoku, which I stopped doing after it became too difficult.  I cannot wait until the social worker comes tomorrow so that they can see that I am better.  Then I can leave.  The problem is that the desks that they have here match the furniture at me newly done country house (we had to redo it because it flooded).  In fact, I was actually thinking of getting the wooden desk but in white!  That is not going to happen now.  So now I am just being a bored person waiting poisonous dinner to be served.  I did yoga on their napkins they call towels, paced, etc. and now I have been staring out of the window.  By the way, the Empire State Building is green and orange but the orange looks like brown because of the bars on the windows.  It is weird because I still do not feel like am in a mental institution.  I cannot admit to myself that I am in my worst nightmareâ€¦
