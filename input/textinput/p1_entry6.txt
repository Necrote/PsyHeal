I got to the hospital at around 11:30 this morning and wasbrought to CPEP.  At CPEP they took my vitals and talked to both my parents and I about my depression.  I think that, by itself, took about four hours so by the time I was taken into the back room (the observation room) it was about 3:30pm.
They made me change into a weird hospital blue button up top and pants that could fit four of me in them.  After, they stuck me in a small room with two beds and an old fashioned TV.  I was stuck in there with nothing but water, bread, and some salad as company.  The only time I made contact with humans was when they came to take my vitals.
At around 7pm, when I was about to die of boredom, they put me in a wheelchair (apparently it is mandatory for a patient to be in a wheelchair) and took me upstairs.  When I got to the 21 West mental institution for kids 11-15, they took my vitals and put me in a prison box that they call my room.  There is nothing on the walls, two beds, and the smallest bathroom which smelled like a sewer (sadly I know what a sewer smells like).
After being awkward in my room for about twenty minutes, where I tried to gain the courage to meet the others, I left the cell and went to see After Earth – which was being projected – with my fellow inmates.
About ten minutes to the end of the movie my new roommate, Alaska, came in.  Once the movie was over, she took me back to the cell and gave me the down low on the place.  To get out you have to be nice to everyone (ok), behave (ok), and not make friends (ok…wait what?!?).
I found out that she is on here because she tried to kill herself in school.  She is really nice and we get along well.  I guess something good might come out of this hellhole…
