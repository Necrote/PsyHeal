I just got back from meeting with my mom.  She got me a muffin and hot chocolate with whipped cream from our favorite, usual Sunday morning breakfast diner.  I miss home so much!  I told her about last night and she agrees that it was weird and scary.  I called daddy and he cried.  He told me that he was sorry and that he cries every night.  Even though he came yesterday, mom says that he is not mentally ready to see me again.  When you get visitors all of the patients and their visitors sit around a table and talk.  Every kid gets food because the food here is horrible.  I got another letter from Ethan today.  I put them on my desk so that my room is not barren.  This letter was written on our Christmas card.  I think that we have gotten closer since I got in here.  I finally realize how much I care about him.  I know that I was considering boarding school before but now I realize that I am too young to leave my family.  I am only thirteen and I have five years to grow up and be with my family.  After those five years I will be ready to leave but right now I am content to stay with my family.
After that we went for drama therapy which actually has nothing to do with drama.  In there we discussed words like peer-pressure and love which caused us to bring up personal stories.  Some were about respect and beating people up and others were about bullying â€“ it seems like most everyone here has been bullied.  There was this one girl who is thirteen and has a daughter that is two years old.  She came here for anger management.  I cannot believe I thought my life was bad.  These people have such stressful lives.  Even the two boys from last night shared.  People have been rude to them and one takes drugs and smokes.  He was the one who lived next door.
