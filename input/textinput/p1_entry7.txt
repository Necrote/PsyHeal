Oh my god!  So my day started at 6am when they woke me up to take my vitals.  Why would they take my vitals that early in the morning?!?  After that they told Alaska and I to go to sleep…how do you do that?  Well, after I fell asleep they woke me up at 8am to have a blood test…then told me to go back to sleep.  By that point I was wide awake and I stared at the white ceiling until Alaska woke up.  When she woke up we got our breakfast treys and brought them to our room.  Once we were done we went to the main room where the TV was on and we drew.  At 12:15 my parents came and I cried.  I miss them so much and it kills me that I am not allowed to leave this floor.  In fact, there are times when you cannot even leave your room!  These people really like being in charge.  When my parents lefts I took my donuts and bag of clothes and went to my room (after everything was searched which is a total evasion of privacy).  The prison guards summoned us to art therapy where we proceeded to paint bird houses and a path through life.  It was nice to paint but if I could trade that to leave this building for just five minutes, I would.  I think I am getting cabin fever.  So here I am writing instead of having iPod time.  IPod time is where you get iPods with no internet access and bad games.  Oh yeah!  Did I mention that we are cut off from the outside world?  No electronics aloud.  None.  Zippo.  This is the 21st century!  How many more days until I can escape this place?
