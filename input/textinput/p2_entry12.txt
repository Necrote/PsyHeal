It is a little after 11:00am and Alaska and I just got back to our room.  By the way, after last night we requested to move to another room so we switched to a room two to three doors away from our previous room.  Alaska and I got back from morning stretches where we did not do much.  The teacher was pretty mean and Alaska thinks that it makes sense because the woman is white – they white nurses here tend to be mean.  In the class we did stretches that I did when I was in my pre-school yoga class.  The language that came out of these girl’s mouths are the only difference between then and now.  They are so impolite and they curse at the teachers.  While we were in morning stretches the fire alarm went off at least eight times, and the alarm is not like the school alarms when we have fire drills.  The alarm is like the loud scream in movies when you see people holding their ears and falling down.  After last night I thought that hell had broken loose.
