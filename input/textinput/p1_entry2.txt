The doctor says that i will recover soon. I am also thinkingthe same. Yesterday, I was feeling a bit stressed out but after having my medicine today, it is better. I want to get well sonn and go to my family. My wife and son are waiting for me. I will take the medicines as prescribed and will not deviate from what is planned for me. My nurse is very friendly. She is making sure that I get best treatment and recover soon. I feel a it disturbed at times but that will also go away son. God, help me to become better. I think so that is enough for today. Let me see how my treatment proceeds. Everything will be good amen.
