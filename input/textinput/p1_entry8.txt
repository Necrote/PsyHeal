I am in my room right now and 21 West is in chaos.  The kid next door Heraldo freaked out and is now strapped to his bed and another boy is throwing stuff.  There are many security guards and I do not feel safe.  This is the second time that they have come â€“ the first was because a girl was upset (aka. Tantrum)  I am so scared and Alaska and I are in our room listening by the door trying to find out what is going on.  People are crying, there are sounds like handcuffs or chains, and voices are just getting louder.  Heraldo has a sheet over his head and he is screaming for them to get off of him.  I am writing this as this is happening so this might not make too much sense.  Alaska is on the floor crying and we are both wondering why we are here.  There is a guy with a mask and they are calling for more guards.
Alaska and I just talked to a nurse because we were freaking out.  She told us that Heraldo and the other guy do this a lot and that they like provoking the workers.  I cannot believe that this is happening right now.  Presently the two boys are yelling to each other.  They are cursing, yelling, talking about breaking out, etc.  Though the nurses have assured us that we are safe I am still scared because Alaska and my room is the closest to theirs.  I do not think that we are going to get much sleep tonight.  These boys are completely disgusting.  I am just going to keep writing because this has to be documented.  They are about to turn the lights out because it is 11:00pm but I just want to say: I hope that I get better soon because I do not think that I can stay here much longer.
