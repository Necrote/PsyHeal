Last night I heard my mom say she wishes maybe, I had cancer or something, instead of what I got is my bipolar. That really made me sad and made me mad! When I finally asked my mom, “why,” she said, “If only you had cancer or lymphoma or something like that. Everyone would understand, everyone would feel sorry… That would be so much easier than bipolar!” She told me I would have a greater chance of being cured and of living, of not dying. She said I’d have fun with all the flowers, balloons, toys, and special snacks! She said important people like rappers and athletes might even help me, might even do fun things for me! And if I shaved my head bald, no one would make fun, they would even say, “that’s cool.” Mom says then, insurance would cover more, and people would maybe even help me with money, if we needed it… Instead, nobody wants to give anything nice or pay any attention to a “bad” kid like me.
I’m just a waste. Is it my fault? My mom’s? My dad’s? But my doctor says I can help myself some. And my family. There are things I can do, to help my BP. So, I don’t feel all that bad. I just need people to care, too. Not just to be “sick” of my “sickness.” I want to be “normal”! I want to be well! I want to be good! I want to try! I will! But, please, please, help me and care for me, too, even if I don’t have cancer!
